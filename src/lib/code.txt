**Key Tips for Presentation:**

* **Be Realistic:** It's an internship. Don't claim millions in savings unless you have a direct, verifiable metric. Focus on the *potential* and the *contribution*.
* **Emphasize "How":** Briefly explain *how* your work led to these benefits. For example, JUnit tests *led to* reduced bug-fixing costs.
* **Qualitative is OK:** For many intern projects, the benefits are more qualitative ("improved developer confidence," "enhanced quality") than precise financial figures. That's perfectly acceptable.
* **Focus on Citi:** Always link the benefit back to Citi's strategic goals or operational efficiency.
* **Concise Language:** Use brief, impactful phrases for each benefit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, this "Assumptions, Constraints, and Dependencies" slide is about acknowledging the underlying conditions that influenced your project and its execution. Even as an intern, it's good to demonstrate an understanding of these project management concepts.

Here's a structured approach for your internship projects:

---

### **Assumptions, Constraints, and Dependencies**

---

**Assumptions**

(Factors that were considered true or real for your project to proceed as planned.)

* **Availability of Required Software/Tools:** Assumed access to necessary development tools, IDEs, libraries (e.g., Spring Boot, ReactJS, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, JUnit) and licenses within the Citi environment.
* **Access to Documentation/Resources:** Assumed availability of relevant API documentation, existing codebase knowledge, and internal guidelines for writing JUnit tests and developing new applications.
* **Stable Development Environment:** Assumed a stable and accessible development environment (e.g., network connectivity, internal servers) for coding, testing, and running applications.
* **Clarity of Requirements:** Assumed that the project requirements (especially for the documented APIs and the general concept of the Smart Portfolio Manager) were sufficiently clear to proceed with development.
* **Guidance from Manager/Team:** Assumed ongoing guidance and feedback from my manager and team members when encountering technical blockers or design questions.

**Constraints**

(Limitations outside your direct control that affected your project.)

* **Time Limitation:** The primary constraint was the 2-month internship duration, which dictated the scope and depth of features that could be implemented for the Smart Portfolio Manager.
* **Resource Access/Permissions:** Limited access to certain production-like environments or specific internal Citi systems/APIs (as is typical for interns), requiring development to be done in isolated or mocked environments.
* **Existing Codebase Complexity (for JUnit):** The complexity and size of existing Java codebases presented a learning curve and time investment to thoroughly understand before writing comprehensive JUnit tests.
* **Security & Compliance Guidelines:** Adherence to strict Citi security policies and compliance guidelines (e.g., data handling, authentication mechanisms) for any developed solution, which sometimes adds complexity to implementation.
* **No Direct Production Deployment:** The Smart Portfolio Manager was a proof-of-concept/prototype and not intended for immediate production deployment, which influenced the level of production-readiness required (e.g., extensive error handling, scalability for millions of users).

**Dependencies**

(Critical internal or external factors that your project relied upon for successful delivery.)

* **Manager's Guidance and Feedback:** Crucial for understanding project scope, technical direction, and resolving impediments.
* **Team Collaboration:** Reliance on team members for code reviews, knowledge sharing, and troubleshooting assistance.
* **Existing Citi Infrastructure:** Dependence on Citi's internal network, development servers, and potentially internal libraries or services.
* **Defined API Documentation:** For the RESTful API project, the success was directly dependent on the clarity and completeness of the documentation provided by the manager.
* **Learning Curve for New Technologies:** Success was dependent on my ability to quickly learn and apply new technologies (ReactJS, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, specific Spring Boot features) within the internship timeframe.

---

**Tips for Presenting:**

* **Be concise:** Use bullet points and brief descriptions.
* **Be honest:** It's okay to admit limitations, as it shows an understanding of real-world project challenges.
* **Frame from your perspective:** As an intern, these are the assumptions/constraints *you* faced or worked within.
* **Don't dwell:** Acknowledge them and move on, focusing more on your solutions and benefits.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Okay, this "Risks" slide is about identifying potential challenges and how they were (or would be) mitigated. As an intern, you're not expected to have managed major project risks, but you can identify risks that you observed or that could have impacted your work, and how they were inherently managed within your internship setup.

Here's a structured approach for your internship projects:

-----

### **Risks: Potential Challenges & Mitigation**

-----

**Overview:** During my internship, while direct risk management wasn't my primary role, I observed and was indirectly involved in mitigating potential risks inherent in software development within a large financial institution.

### **Roles and Responsibilities: My Internship Project Team**

-----

| Role                   | Responsibilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Project Sponsor** | My Project Sponsor (likely a senior leader in your department/vertical at Citi) championed the overall initiative or the importance of quality assurance and innovation. They would have provided the high-level business case and strategic direction that enabled projects like mine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Customer** | For the JUnit testing work, the "customer" was primarily internal development teams and ultimately the end-users of Citi's applications who benefit from stable, error-free software. \<br\>\<br\> For the Smart Portfolio Manager, the "customer" was conceptually the end-user (e.g., a Citi client) for whom the prototype was envisioned, verifying that the solution addressed their potential needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Project Manager** | My direct manager, **[Manager's Name]**, acted as my Project Manager. \<br\> \* Leads and directs the project planning and execution efforts for my internship tasks. \<br\> \* Oversees deliverables and manages expectations for my contributions. \<br\> \* Manages issues, risks, scope, and schedule relevant to my internship projects. \<br\> \* Provided crucial guidance, mentorship, and regular check-ins throughout the 2-month period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Team Members** | **[Your Name] - Software Development Intern** \<br\> \* **Helped plan what needs to be done (WBS):** Collaborated with manager to understand project requirements and break down tasks. \<br\> \* **Completed work packages or tasks:** Primarily responsible for developing JUnit test cases, and implementing both frontend (ReactJS) and backend (Spring Boot, MongoDB, PostgreSQL) components for the Smart Portfolio Manager and RESTful APIs. \<br\> \* **Helped identify changes from plan:** Communicated progress and raised potential challenges or opportunities for refinement. \<br\> \* **Helped identify constraints and assumptions:** Identified technical limitations or knowledge gaps and sought solutions. \<br\> \* **Helped identify issues, risks, changes:** Reported blockers or potential issues to my manager promptly. \<br\> \* **Attended project team meetings:** Participated in relevant team syncs and discussions. \<br\> \* **Wrote comprehensive JUnit tests:** Focused on ensuring high code quality and reliability for 6 key repositories and existing modules. |

**Key Tips for Presentation:**

  * **Focus on Your Role:** Elaborate most on the "Team Members" section as that's your direct responsibility.
  * **Be Specific with Names (if appropriate):** If you're comfortable and your manager is aware, putting their name under "Project Manager" is a nice touch.
  * **Keep Other Roles High-Level:** For the Sponsor and Customer, describe their *typical* role in the context of your projects, as you likely didn't interact with them directly in a formal project management capacity.
  * **Customize:** Adjust the bullet points under "Team Members" to reflect your specific actions and contributions even more precisely.
  * **Show Awareness:** This slide demonstrates that you understand how your individual work fits into a larger organizational structure and project framework.

Okay, this "Roles and Responsibilities Cont'd" slide provides more generalized roles within a larger project context. As an intern, your direct interaction with some of these might have been minimal or indirect. However, you can use this slide to demonstrate your awareness of how these roles contribute to the overall success of projects within an organization like Citi.

Here's how to approach this slide, focusing on how these roles *would* (or did indirectly) impact your work:

| Role               | Responsibilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Senior Management** | While my direct interaction was limited, Senior Management would have provided the high-level strategic direction that necessitated the focus on both robust quality assurance (my JUnit work) and innovation in client solutions (Smart Portfolio Manager). They are critical in setting the overall technology strategy and resolving broader organizational impediments that could impact projects like mine. My manager would have provided updates to executives on my progress within the internship program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **E3 Coach** | (Assuming "E3 Coach" refers to a mentor or specialized coach within Citi's E3 program or similar talent development initiatives) \<br\> If you had an E3 Coach: They would have provided additional guidance, feedback on soft skills, career discussions, and a broader perspective on professional development beyond the immediate project tasks. \<br\>\<br\> If you did not have a formal E3 coach, you can state: "I did not have a dedicated E3 Coach, but received similar mentorship and guidance through my manager and broader team."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Functional Manager** | This role, distinct from my direct Project Manager, would likely refer to managers overseeing the specific business functions or applications for which I was writing JUnit tests. They would provide vital context on the business domain and user requirements, indirectly guiding the areas where robust testing was most critical. They might also be involved in the user acceptance testing (UAT) or functional validation of the applications I contributed to. My manager might have consulted them for requirements documentation for the RESTful APIs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Finance** | While not directly involved in my day-to-day coding, the Finance function at Citi plays a critical role in allocating resources and budgets for technology projects. Their oversight ensures that projects like the Smart Portfolio Manager are strategically aligned and cost-effective, even at the prototyping stage, and that the resources for QA initiatives are appropriately funded to ensure the overall health of Citi's IT infrastructure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Other Stakeholder** | This category could include various internal teams or individuals with whom I had indirect interaction or whose work impacted mine: \<br\> \* **QA Teams:** Professionals in dedicated Quality Assurance teams who might have used or benefited from the enhanced unit tests. \<br\> \* **DevOps/Infrastructure Teams:** Who manage the development environments and pipelines that I utilized. \<br\> \* **Cyber Security Teams:** Whose guidelines and policies I adhered to when developing solutions. \<br\> \* **Training/L\&D:** Provided access to learning resources that aided in skill development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

**Key Tips for Presentation:**

  * **Acknowledge Indirect Influence:** For most of these roles, you didn't have direct responsibilities, but their functions influenced the environment and context of your work. Frame it that way.
  * **Be Truthful:** Only elaborate on roles you genuinely interacted with or whose impact you clearly understood. If you didn't have an "E3 Coach," simply state that and explain how similar support was provided (e.g., by your manager).
  * **Conciseness:** Use bullet points and brief explanations.
  * **Show Awareness:** The goal is to demonstrate your understanding of the broader organizational structure and how various departments contribute to successful project delivery at Citi.
